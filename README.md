Python clock
--
Simple script that prints the time as a python class. I took [this thing](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3258164602) as the reference

Build & Run
--
Either compile `clock.c` and place it where you need or execute it directly as file is a valid shell script

Dependencies
--
- `/etc/localtime` file  
- POSIX-compatible system  
- [`tcc`](https://bellard.org/tcc/) if you want to run code as a script
